<p>Description: I'm lost in the learn vicious circle.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Recently, I fall into the learn vicious circle.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>
<strong>When I learn programming, meeting the problems is very normal. However, there is a problem that when I solve out one problem, another problem appears in front of me. Therefore, I have to solve the new problem. So back and forth. The effectiveness is so low. I spend a lot of time, but got less. This is the learn vicious circle. It suckes me!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>
<strong>My english is so poor. It's hard to continue my article. Should I be trapped there.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>
<strong>Just now, I heared tha the TV series “White night is fierce” has updated. What a amazing news! I think I have to watch it. So today's blog just stopped here. For the sake of my poor english.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>
<strong>By the way, I work out a way to figure out the learn vicious circle. I decide the main route to learn the programming. If I meet another problem, whether I have spare time is the consideration of it. If I do, I can go to learn something about the problem. Oppositely, I may put it down. So the learn vicious circle problem has been solved.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>
<strong>By the end of today, my main route is learning Java deeply by doing algorithm exercises on the leetcode and learning the Python for data analysis. Java and Python are the main programming language that I should be good at. Other things is the aid of them.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>
<strong>Em&hellip;that's all! Finally, pay homeage to my poor english.(I'm going to watch the TV series)</strong></p>
